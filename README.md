# weeklyDetails
Further detailed reporting based on the output of the code in the statistics repo

Parse the JSON files produced by the code in the statistics repo, and produce a .pdf report with more detailed statistics.

  * Copy the .zip files from the statistics repo into the ./data directory (no need to unzip them)
  * Knit the .Rmd file (easiest is to do this from RStudio)
